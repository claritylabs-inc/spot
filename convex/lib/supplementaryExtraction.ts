Focus on:
- Regulatory contacts: state department of insurance, regulatory bodies, ombudsman offices — with phone, email, structured address
- Claims contacts: how to report claims, claims department contact info, hours of operation
- Third-party administrators (TPAs) for claims handling
- Cancellation notice period in days
- Nonrenewal notice period in days
- Complaint filing procedures and contacts
- Governing law or jurisdiction provisions
- Additional policy-specific facts that are useful for memory and retrieval even if they do not belong in the strict primary schema

Look for regulatory notices, complaint contact sections, claims reporting instructions, and cancellation/nonrenewal provisions throughout the document.

Every regulatoryContacts, claimsContacts, and thirdPartyAdministrators row must include sourceSpanIds from the source evidence. Omit contacts when source spans are unavailable.

For auxiliaryFacts:
- ONLY capture facts that are NOT already present in the structured extraction results above.
- Do not duplicate information that has already been extracted — no policy numbers, insured names, addresses, coverage limits, deductibles, or any other field that appears in the already-extracted data.
- Capture concrete, policy-specific facts as structured key/value pairs.
- Prioritize facts that agents may need later but that are often omitted from strict schemas: policyholder names, insured person names, driver names, ages, dates of birth, marital status, garaging information, lienholders, household members, vehicle assignments, schedule row details, and other discrete identifiers — but ONLY if they are not already in the extracted data.
- Use short normalized keys like "policyholder_name", "policyholder_age", "insured_name", "driver_age", "driver_date_of_birth", "garaging_zip", "vehicle_principal_driver".
- Use subject when the fact belongs to a specific person, vehicle, property, or scheduled item.
- Do not invent facts.
- Do not include vague boilerplate or generic form language.
- Do not repeat large narrative excerpts; keep facts atomic.

Return JSON only.`;
